      <h1>Hi! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Pablo <small>Senior Frontend Developer @ QubicaAMF Europe</small></h1>
      <p>
        I'm a Web Developer specialized in crafting advanced applications and optimizing development
        processes. I actively strive to improve the code quality and performance of the software I
        work on, without neglecting the Developer Experience so sought after by (us) developers.
        <br /><br />I am an advocate of Agile Methodologies to facilitate Continuous Integration /
        Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) for complex projects that are constantly evolving.
