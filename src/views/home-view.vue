        <h1>Hi! <span class="wave">ðŸ‘‹</span> I'm Pablo <small>Lead Frontend Engineer @ iubenda</small></h1>
        <p>
          I'm a Web Developer who builds advanced apps and makes development work better. I'm really passionate about creating high-quality software, while making sure it's still enjoyable for developers to work with! <br /><br />I strongly believe in Agile methods to help with Continuous Integration /
          Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) for complex projects that need to evolve and change over time. I love improving code quality and optimizing processes.
